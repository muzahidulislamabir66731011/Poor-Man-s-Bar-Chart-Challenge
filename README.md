# Poor Man's Bar Chart Challenge

A simple Python program that creates a text-based bar chart showing the frequency of letters in a given sentence.
---
## 📊 What It Does

This program analyzes how frequently each letter appears in a sentence and displays the result using `#` symbols to represent counts — a *"poor man's"* version of a visual chart.

It works with **Latin alphabet characters** (`a`–`z`) and is case-insensitive.

---

## ✍️ How It Works

- Converts input text to lowercase  
- Counts how many times each letter (a–z) appears  
- Displays a bar for each letter using `#`  
- Shows **all 26 letters**, even if some are not used
